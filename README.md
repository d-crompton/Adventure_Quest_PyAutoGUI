# Adventure Quest Monster Battling Bot

This repository contains a script I wrote to automate the desktop version of Adventure Quest. This script (starting from Battleon) will fight a monster then return to town to heal and refill potions before fighting again.

This will repeat until your character levels up or the appearance of a random encounter that requires user interaction (e.g., a random chest or a leprachaun's dialogue)

**_This script is not intended to be used for botting but instead a way to demonstrate my knowledge of Python and PyAutoGui_**

The script makes the following assumptions:

1. The screen resolution is **1920 x 1080**
2. Your character's weapons are arranged in the following way:
   - Default weapon
   - Energy weapon
   - Earth weapon
   - Fire weapon
   - Wind weapon
   - Water weapon
   - Darkness weapon
3. Your character's pets are arranged in the following way:
   - Ice pet
   - Energy pet
   - Fire pet
   - Wind pet
   - Water pet
   - Darkness pet
   - Light pet
